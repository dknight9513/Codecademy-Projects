/*This program will randomly select a starter pokemon,
and then randomly select a pokemon from the evolutionary
families for it to evolve into. Probabilites will be set
such that pokemon are more likely to evolve into their
actual evolutions. Smaller chances will be set that allow
the pokemon to evolve either into the wrong next stage
evolution or skip all the way to their final evolution.
Flavor text will be generated based on which of those
situations occur. Additionally, a number of notable trainers
from the series are randomly selected from to be included
in the final output of the program
